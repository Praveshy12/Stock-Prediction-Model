# Stock Prediction Model
This project is designed to predict stock prices using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, and LSTM.                              
## Features:
- Historical stock price analysis
- Time series prediction using LSTM
- Data visualization for stock trends  
## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the prediction model:
python predict.py                       
## Results:
